	<h3>2017 Ladies Lectureship Retreat Volunteer Information:</h3>
	<p>Volunteering at the Ladies Lectureship Retreat provides a complimentary registration, t-shirt and lunch daily, and still allows most volunteers to experience the main sessions and several workshops throughout the series. Plus, it is a blast! We will need volunteers from Friday, January 27th at about 12PM until 8PM and Saturday, January 28th at around 8AM until 4PM. Volunteers do not have to be available from Friday through Saturday, although we do prefer that you are present both days. We require every volunteer to be available for at least one full day so you can be a part of a team. This allows you to be fully engaged in serving with your team. The Retreat address is: 1968 Dean Road, Jacksonville, FL 32216</p>

	<p>Below are a variety of service areas where we use volunteers: Set up, Registration, Resources, Welcome Greeters, Lunch Facilitation, Production Team, General Runner, Tear Down Team, and Cleanup.</p>
